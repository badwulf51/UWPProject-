# Darkest Dungeon Companion App

For my UWP project I have chosen to make a companion app to the game "Darkest Dungeon" which is avalible on nearly every device possible even windows phone. The following document will outline the mechanics of the game and how the app correlates to them. 

## A Bit About The Game Itself

Before I go into the details of how the app works and what features it has I think it would be best to outline some brief mechanics of the game first as they are crucial in understanding how the app works. Darkest Dungeon (or, DD for short) is a game about making the best of a bad situation. The player is incontrol of a small hamlet on the bring of destruction and the player must guide various teams of "Heroes" throughout 5 unique areas. The purpose of bringing heroes out on expeditions to these areas is mainly for loot which can be used to upgrade your hamlet but also to try and stop the forces of cosmic horror from descending upon your hamlet. DD is by NO means at all an easy game. Often called by many as one of the hardest games of all time a guide or walkthough close at hand is almost needed if you wish to prevail. Thats where the idea for my app came from, a close at hand app that can give you the right info you need for each area. The app displays the 5 key areas of the game and clicking into them will show you tips on how to best survive the area as well as an "Expedition Guide" which shows you what items to take to each area (Example: the warrens are filled with disease ridden swine folk who like to use poison moves, so bringing lots of "anti-venom" to that area will help the player greately). One of DD's greatest features is its sound design which I also incorporated into my app, throughout the game you are haunted by narration of your ghostly ancestor so I though it was only fitting to add his dialogue lines to the app itself. Another big feature is the profit calculator. After each adventure you are shown how much loot you have brought back (which is automatically sold) but the game DOES not actually tell you how much the loot is worth, its a case of "Huh, my total money just went up a good bit but I'm not sure why), So, I added the feature for users to see how much total loot they obtained by adding them up with the apps calculator, calculator is simple to use as each loot option corresponds to a certain button and adds them all to a total.
